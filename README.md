### BikeTrackr
Built using SwiftUI and MVVM, this is a bicycle maintenance tracker where you can log repairs, new parts, and other maintenance that was done on your bike. The app utilizes SwiftData for data storage. Async/Await is also utilized to avoid blocking the main thread on more expensive operations such as fetching, removing, and saving data. Invoice scanning to create service records and Strava integration to follow!

### Local Grounds

Find coffee shops in your area. Pan around to different areas of the map and find coffee shops there too. This app uses MapKit, Core Location, and the Four Square API to gather information such as an address, and reviews.

### Tech News
Leveraging the News API, this app displays the top headlines in tech. This app was built using the MVVM architecture, uses async/await, image caching with URLCache, and I focused on a simple design that works with both light and dark mode.
